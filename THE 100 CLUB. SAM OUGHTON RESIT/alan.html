<aside class="lionfacts">
  <p class="lionfactstext"> Alan Shearer is a retired English footballer who was regarded as one of the world’s best strikers. Recognized for his skills at a tender age of thirteen, Shearer went on to play for various clubs such as Southampton, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United in a career spanning two decades. He also represented England in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Other than just being known as a good player, he is also famous for being purchased by various clubs for huge amounts of money. Alan has scored around 49 of his 206 goals for Newcastle only by headshots, a feat which is rarely achieved by most footballers. He is associated with various charities and even during his days as a footballer, he took time out for charitable causes. He was associated with the organisation NSPCC, which works towards the protection of children from any form of abuse. He also raised money for this organisation through various football matches. Alan has also started his own charity organisation ‘The Alan Shearer Foundation’. In his playing days he was considered to be one of the richest footballers around the globe and still holds this reputation, even after his retirement. He continues be associated with the sport by giving his opinions through post match discussions on national television.
260 preimer league goals, 1 premier league trpohy and 5 time preimer league player of the year.There are some pertinent and lesser-known top facts about Alan Shearer including having the Honorary Freedom of the City of Newcastle. This was provided to him in 2000 as a tribute to his strong leadership skills when captaining Newcastle United as well as England.
Shearer's captaincy roles were thought to have ended up raising the profile of Newcastle as a city and just a year later he was awarded hi OBE in the 2001 Queen's Honours list. This was changed to a CBE in 2016 after his services to the North East of England community.
Shearer was made a Doctor of Civil Law by Northumbria University with the University vice-chancellor stating that "throughout his career Alan Shearer has been hard-working, committed, disciplined and focused in his endeavours, fighting back from career-threatening injuries with great determination and courage." Shearer was then also rewarded with the same status from Newcastle University in 2009.Among top facts about Alan Shearer, more specifically considering his personal life, it is notable to indicate that he married Lainya (second from left), who he met while at Southampton, in 1991.
During their 29 years of marriage, they have three children - Hollie, 23 , Chloe, 26  and Will, 18 (probably at the time of writing, they might be several years older). Lainya has kept a low profile despite her husband's reputation and has been said to be eager to remain out of the limelight.
Not much else is known of the former footballer's love life in so far as he prefers to keep private life out of the spotlight and his privacy is the matter of his concern.
