      <p class="overview">Since the Premier League's formation at the beginning of the 1992â€“93 season, a total of 33 players have scored 100 or more goals in the competition; collectively, these players are collectively referred to as the Premier League 100 Club. On this website I have showcased the top 7 of these 33, they all have reached 175 goals and all have had sucessful careers.
      You can learn all about them through the facts, videos and pictures on this page!</p>

  <!-- The aside element essentially connects in with the css page, where I can edit
  and apply aspects to that piece of text. In general, the aside element acts as
  a section of content, aside from the main piece of contact which may be centred
  in the page. Having the welcome text sectioned in the centre, aligned above the
  factfile hyperlinks, is eyecatching to consumers instantly.-->
