<aside class="lionfacts">
  <p class="lionfactstext">Andrew Alexander Cole (born 15 October 1971) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. His professional career lasted from 1988 to 2008, and is mostly remembered for his time with Manchester United, who paid a British record transfer fee to sign him from Newcastle United. Cole spent six years with Manchester United and won eight major trophies, including the Treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1999.

As well as for Manchester United and Newcastle United, Cole also played in the top division of English football for Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Fulham, Manchester City, Portsmouth and Sunderland, as well as in The Football League for Bristol City, Birmingham City, Burnley and Nottingham Forest. He is the third-highest goalscorer in Premier League history with 187 goals, and holds Premier League records for most goals scored in a 42-game season (34), and fastest to score 50 goals (65 matches), as well as being the first player to top the Premier League's goalscoring charts and assist charts in the same season in their own right, in 1993â€“94.Lincoln, Cole's father, emigrated from Jamaica to the United Kingdom in 1957 and worked as a coal miner in Gedling, Nottinghamshire, from 1965 to 1987. Devante, their son, is also a professional football forward who plays for Motherwell FC. Cole was arrested and questioned by police in 2008 after an alleged attack on his wife at their home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire. He was later released on bail.
Cole won damages in an action against the owners of the Daily Star for defamation over the publishing of information about the attack claims and for harms caused to his family by sensationalist reports six months later, via his representative law firm Schillings.
Cole was called in the Panama Papers in April 2016. Cole developed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in June 2014, resulting in kidney failure. He had a kidney transplant in April 2017. Alexander, his nephew, was the one who made the donation.
Cole visited Zimbabwe in 2000 and returned to establish his own charitable organization, the Andy Cole Children's Foundation, to assist AIDS orphans in the region. Since then, the charity has closed its doors.
After suffering kidney failure in 2015 as a result of an airborne virus, he founded the Andy Cole Fund to raise money for Kidney Research UK. He is generally calm and honest, and they despise being alone. He is a person who is willing to go to great lengths to prevent confrontation and maintain peace wherever possible.
