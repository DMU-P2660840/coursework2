<aside class="lionfacts">
  <p class="lionfactstext">Harry Edward Kane is an English professional footballer who presently plays for the English national football team and the ‘Premier League’ club ‘Tottenham Hotspur,’ as a striker. He began his football career with ‘Ridgeway Rovers’ and joined the ‘Arsenal’ youth academy thereafter. He had a stint with ‘Ridgeway Rovers’ again, after which he played for the ‘Watford’ academy, before joining the ‘Tottenham Hotspur’ academy. His first professional contract with ‘Tottenham Hotspur’ was finalized in July 2010, and his first-team debut for the club was in a ‘UEFA Europa League’ match in August 2011. ‘Tottenham’ loaned him to ‘Leyton Orient,’ ‘Millwall,’ ‘Leicester City,’ and ‘Norwich City,’ before he could make a mark for himself in the first-team of the club. Kane has achieved several feats with the club, including finishing as the top scorer of the 2015–2016 and the 2016–17 seasons of the ‘Premier League,’ being named the ‘Premier League Player of the Month’ six times, being included in the ‘PFA Team of the Year’ thrice, receiving the ‘Premier League Golden Boot’ twice, and becoming the ‘PFA Young Player of the Year’ once. He began representing England at the ‘Under-17’ level and moved on to make his senior international debut in a ‘UEFA Euro 2016’ qualifying match in March 2015.He is now up to an extraordinary 178 goals. And more than half of those goals have come on the road after he set the all-time mark for road goals scored in Premier League history (95) with his tally Brighton on March 16.Despite the fact that he is currently one of the top players in the world, he was once released by his boyhood club, Tottenham Hotspur. He was only 9 years old at the time. He was described as “a little overweight.” These statements would come back to haunt the coaching staff who had dismissed him from the programme. Despite being a late bloomer, Kane developed into a lean and powerful 6’2″ attacker, who excels at securing crosses in the air.After Working hard at Tottenham from his debut in 2011, Kane had drastically improved his game. He became a consistent substitute and earned numerous minutes throughout the 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014 seasons. Beginning in the 2014-2015 season, Kane was a big name in Tottenham’s world, helping them to victory in numerous games.

For the 2014-2015 season, Kane worked his way into the starting eleven, helping score the team’s equalizing goal against Hull, scoring two times in a row against Swansea and Burnley, and scoring twice against Chelsea in January of 2015. His newfound scoring prowess earned him the Premier League Player of the Month for January of 2015 and the PFA Young Player of the Year.
