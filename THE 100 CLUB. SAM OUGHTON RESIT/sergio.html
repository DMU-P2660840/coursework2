<aside class="lionfacts">
  <p class="lionfactstext">Sergio Agüerois an Argentine footballer who plays for the Argentine national football team and the ‘Premier League’ club ‘Manchester City.’ He has been a football fanatic since his childhood days in Buenos Aires. At the age of 15, he became the youngest Argentine player to participate in the reputed tournament ‘Argentine Primera División.’ Impressed by his magnificent performance, the ‘La Liga’ club ‘Atlético Madrid’ acquired him in 2006. With ‘Atlético,’ he has scored 101 goals in the 234 games that he has played in. He also assisted his team in a major way in the ‘UEFA Europa League’ and the ‘UEFA Super Cup’ in 2010. In 2011, ‘Manchester City’ offered him a contract, which he gladly accepted. Soon, he broke many records and became the highest goal-scorer among non-European players of the league. In November 2017, he further became the all-time highest goal-scorer for ‘Manchester City.’ Sergio has represented his national team in two ‘FIFA World Cups’ and one ‘Copa América.’What City fans may not have realized at the time was just how important he would be in that transformation. Thirteen trophies and 254 goals later, Aguero has cemented his status as a Manchester City legend, and the 31-year-old has shown no signs of slowing down.In his first season at Manchester City, he scored 20 goals and became the best player of the year.
In 2011–2012 season, the player's last-minute goal against Queens Park Rangers led to Manchester City winning the title and Manchester City, who has not won the English Premier League since 1986, achieved its dream.
His success continued in 2016-2017, with the arrival of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City.
He has succeeded during his football career, such as 5 goals against Newcastle, 3 Poker (4 goals), and he broke Alan Shearer's record with 12 hat-tricks. In the history of the English Premier League, an Argentinian player was the first hat-trick record holder.
He has also achieved a lot of success in the national team. In 2006, he was called up to Argentina's senior national team, and in the same year, started playing for the Argentine senior soccer team. He played in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as well as the 2011 Copa America. Aguero also has a very bad defeat experience in national games.
In the final game of the 2014 World Cup, they lost to the German national team and could not win the championship. He also played in the 2015 Copa America. After the failure in the 2018 World Cup, Aguero and his teammates in the Argentine national team in the 2019 Copa del Rey competition could only win a bronze medal.
